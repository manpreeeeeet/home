# Deploy Ktor application to a VPS using github actions
<div class="h-1 w-full my-4 bg-slate-800"></div>

## Overview
In this article, we will be deploying a Ktor server to a digital-ocean droplet.
The setup will be as follows:
* Github action will build a fatJar and docker image.
* Github action will run the docker image on a VPS.

## Setting up the project
Ktor application can be deployed in many [ways](https://ktor.io/docs/server-deployment.html). In this article,
we will build a `fatJar` using the Ktor Gradle plugin. To build a `fatJar` configure the Ktor plugin as follows:
1. Configure the Ktor Plugin.
```kts
plugins {
    id("io.ktor.plugin") version "3.0.1"
}
```
2. Make sure the [main class](https://ktor.io/docs/server-dependencies.html#create-entry-point) is configured.
```kts
application {
    mainClass.set("io.ktor.server.netty.EngineMain")
}
```
3. Set the name of jar file.
```kts
ktor {
    fatJar {
        archiveFileName.set("hello-world.jar")
    }
}
```

## Creating the Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM amazoncorretto:17
COPY build/libs/fat.jar /app/fat.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/fat.jar"]
```


## Github Action Setup
Create a file called `cd.yml` in `.github/workflows` at the root of your project.
```
.
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── cd.yml
└── project-files

```

In the `cd.yml` file we will create 3 separate [github jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-jobs-in-a-workflow): one to build the jar file, one for building docker image, and one for running the application on the VPS.
1. The first job builds the `fatjar` and uploads it as an artifact that we can use in our subsequent jobs.
```yaml
build-jar-file:
  runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
  steps:
    - name: Check out repository code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        distribution: 'oracle'
        java-version: '17'
        cache: 'gradle'
        cache-dependency-path: |
          **/.gradle*
          **/gradle-wrapper.properties

    - run:
        ./gradlew build

    - name: upload the jar file
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: statsify-jar
        path: build/libs/fat.jar
        overwrite: true
```
2. Create and publish the docker image.
```yaml
push-to-docker:
  needs: [ build-jar-file ]
  runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
  permissions:
    packages: write
    contents: read
  steps:
    - name: Check out repository code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: download the jar file
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: statsify-jar
        path: build/libs/
    - name: echo files
      run: ls -lh build/libs/

    - name: Build image
      run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag $IMAGE_NAME

    - name: Log in to registry
      run: echo "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" | docker login ghcr.io -u ${{ github.actor }} --password-stdin
        #
    - name: Push image
      run: |
        IMAGE_ID=ghcr.io/${{ github.repository_owner }}/$IMAGE_NAME
        docker tag $IMAGE_NAME $IMAGE_ID
        docker push $IMAGE_ID
```
3. Run the docker image on VPS.
```yaml
name: Build the Jar File
on: [ push ]
```

## Dockerize the app
```yaml
docker action
```

[//]: # (## Handling ENV variables)
https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action + github secrets should do the trick


## Docker compose
the docker compose file needs to reach the vps. strategies for that?
* scp the file?
* maybe rsync
